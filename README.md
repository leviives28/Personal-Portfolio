# Personal Project Portfolio

## This is the code for my personal online portfolio, and is very likely to be version 1

Website can be viewed at [https://leviives.dev](https://leviives.dev/)


### Purpose

The purpose of this website is to serve information about myself and some of the projects I have completed online.


### Features

#### JavaScript

Aside from basic serving of html content, the website has JavaScript features including 
- Form Validation
- Slide show effect of home page projects and reviews


#### Database Integration

The site not only retrieves reviews from a backend database, but also saves new reviews to the database, but only once the submitted review is verified as being legitimate against a predefined authentication code in the database which is submitted alongside the form. 


#### Express Server

Custom express back end server which hosts the endpoints for enabling the frontend to send and retrieve data from the database.


### Not included
I purposely have not included the web server config files, the database schema, nor required packages.


### Status
This is a personal project, but I would like it to be public, so this repository is to be archived
